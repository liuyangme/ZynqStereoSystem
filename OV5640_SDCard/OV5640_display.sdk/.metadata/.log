The timer begins counting either upon receipt of frame sync (external fsync mode) or completion of vsize lines (free run mode). It resets with a subsequent start-of-packet ( s_axis_s2mm_tvalid ) assertion. When a value different than the current IRQDelayCount is written to this field, the internal delay counter is reset to the new value.
Setting this value to zero disables the delay counter interrupt.
